# Case Study - Cyclistic Bike Share


## Introduction
This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program through Coursera. In this case study, I will be showcasing the skills I have learned through the certificate program such as SQL, Tableau, as well as the phases of the data analysis process by using publicly available data to provide insights that can help solve a business task.

## Scenario
I am a Junior Data Analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. Cyclistic currently has two types of riders: casual and annual members. The director of marketing believes maximizing the number of annual memberships is key to the company's future success. As such, my team wants to better understand how the types of riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. Providing meaningful data-driven recommendations will be dependent on my use of data insights and professional data visualizations. 

## About the Company
Cyclistic launched its succesful bike-share offering in 2016, and since then has grown to a fleet of over 5800 bikes that are locked into a network of nearly 700 docking stations around the city of Chicago. 

Cyclistic's current marketing strategy relies on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments through the use of flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while those who purchase annual memberships are known as Cyclistic members.

The company's finance analysts have determined that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth, and rather than designing a marketing campaign targeting all new customers, she believes there is an opportunity to convert casual riders into members. 

In order to design the new marketing campaign, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ by using historical data to identify trends.

Data privacy issues prohibit the data from listing any ridersâ€™ personally identifiable information (PII) so it has been removed. The data contains 13 columns for each unique observation: ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
